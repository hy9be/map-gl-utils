        Methods that add sources return an object ("SourceBoundUtils" in this documentation) that can be chained to allow layers to be added to it:

          ```js
          map.U.addGeoJSONSource('properties')
            .addCircleLayer('properties-line', { lineWidth: 3 })
            .addSymbolLayer('properties-fill', { fillColor: 'hsla(30,30%,60%,0.5)' })
          ```
